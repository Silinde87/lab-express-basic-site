				<h2>Him</h2>
				<p>
					Richard Paul Astley (born 6 February 1966) is a British singer, songwriter and radio
					personality. He rose to fame through his association with the production trio Stock Aitken
					Waterman; his 1987 recording of their song "Never Gonna Give You Up" was a number 1 hit
					single in 25 countries, winning the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Single. His 1988
					single "Together Forever" became his second single to top the US Billboard Hot 100, and
					was one of his eight songs to reach the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. By the time of
					his retirement in 1993, Astley had sold approximately 40 million records worldwide.
				</p>

					Astley made a comeback in 2007, becoming an Internet phenomenon when the music video for
					"Never Gonna Give You Up" became integral to the meme known as "rickrolling". Astley was
					voted "Best Act Ever" by Internet users at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008, and his 2016
					album 50 debuted in the UK at No. 1.

				<h2>Early life</h2>
				<p>
					Astley was born on 6 February 1966 in Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire, the fourth child of
					his family. His parents divorced when he was five and Astley was brought up by his father.
					Astley remained in very close contact with his mother, who lived a few streets away from
					his father. After finding out that his father was the one who kicked his mother out of the
					house, Astley distanced himself from his father. His musical career started when he was
					10, singing in the local church choir.

					During his schooldays, Astley formed and played the drums in a number of local bands,
					where he met guitarist David Morris. After leaving school at sixteen, Astley was employed
					during the day as a driver in his father's market-gardening business and played drums on
					the Northern club circuit at night in bands such as Give Way – specialising in covering
					Beatles and Shadows songs – and FBI, which won several local talent competitions.

				<h2>Career</h2>
				<p>
					In 1985, Astley was performing as a drummer with a soul band named FBI, with Morris on
					guitar. They were a well-known local band writing and performing their own music, gigging
					in pubs and clubs. When FBI's lead singer left the band, and Morris left to concentrate on
					his career in hairdressing, Astley offered to be the lead vocalist. This was when he was
					noticed by the record producer Pete Waterman, who persuaded him to come to London to work
					at the Pete Waterman Limited (PWL) recording studio, with RCA Records publishing his
					records. Under the tutelage of the production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete
					Waterman, known as Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW), Astley was taught about the recording
					process and groomed for his future career, supposedly starting off as the recording studio
					"tea boy". The reason for Astley to be hired as a "tape op" was to overcome his shyness.
					SAW also hired most of FBI, including Morris as a guitarist/songwriter.
